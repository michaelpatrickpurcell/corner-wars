Four Corners is a game for two players which can be played in about ten minutes.\\[1.125ex]

You will need one copy of these rules to share. Each player will need something to write with.\\[1.125ex]

The first player will use {\setmainfont[Scale=0.95]{Century Gothic-Bold} X}s to mark the cells that they claim. The other player will use {\setmainfont[Scale=0.95]{Century Gothic-Bold} O}s.\\[2ex]

{\setmainfont[Scale=0.95]{Century Gothic-Bold}\LARGE Gameplay}\\[1.0ex]

During the game, you will take turns claiming cells on a 15$\times$15 grid. To claim a cell, draw your symbol in that cell.\\[1.125ex]

On the first turn, you must claim the middle cell. Thereafter, you may claim any cell that is orthogonally adjacent to a cell that has already been claimed.\\[1.125ex]

To win, you must form a square by claiming the cell at each of its four corners. Such a square can be of any size and must be aligned with the grid (no diamonds).\\[1.125ex]
