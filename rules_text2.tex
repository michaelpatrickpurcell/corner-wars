{\setmainfont[Scale=0.95]{Century Gothic-Bold}\LARGE Gameplay}\\[1.0ex]

You will take turns claiming cells on a 9$\times$9 grid. You may not claim the middle cell. To claim a cell, draw your symbol in it. \\[1.25ex]

%On the first turn, you must claim a cell that is adjacent to the middle cell. Thereafter, you may claim any cell that is adjacent to either the middle cell or a cell that has already been claimed.\\[1.125ex]

On your turn, you must claim a cell that is orthogonally adjacent to either the middle cell or a cell that has already been claimed.\\[1.25ex]

To win, you must form a square by claiming the cell at each of its four corners. Such a square can be of any size and must be aligned with the grid (no diamonds).\\[1.25ex]
